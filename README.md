# Snap-Catch-O  
A Ball-Catching Game  

Snap-Catch-O is a fun and engaging game developed in C++ where players test their reflexes by catching falling balls. The objective is to move a box horizontally and catch the balls falling from different vertical lanes. As the game progresses, the speed of the falling balls increases, making it more challenging!  

This project was created as part of a graphics course, showcasing fundamental computer graphics and game development concepts.

## Features  
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Balls fall faster as time progresses, making the game increasingly challenging.  
- **Interactive Controls**: Players can move the box horizontally to catch the balls.  
- **Graphics Rendering**: Utilizes graphics libraries to display visuals effectively.  
- **Addictive Fun**: Simple yet challenging gameplay keeps players engaged.

## How to Play  
1. Start the game.  
2. Use the specified keys (e.g., arrow keys or WASD) to move the box horizontally.  
3. Catch the balls as they fall from the vertical lanes.  
4. The game becomes harder as the balls fall faster over time.  

**Goal**: Catch as many balls as possible without missing to achieve the highest score!

## Requirements  
To run Snap-Catch-O, ensure you have the following:  
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio, or Code::Blocks).  
- Graphics library such as **OpenGL** or **graphics.h** (if required by your implementation).  
- Windows or any system compatible with your chosen graphics library.
